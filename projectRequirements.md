The course project will be done in groups of 2. There are two main parts to the project.

Part 1: Design and development of  the program

Description: The purpose of the program is to create a ticket purchasing program that allows for users to log in, purchase tickets, keep records of tickets purchased, and keep information about the user. 

Program Requirements: The following are the program requirements:

    Must be fully functioning including registration, log-in, view events, and purchase tickets

    Tickets should be purchased using “points”, no information should be provided via the user for payment method. Default each user to an allotted number of points and have a way to add to the points from the menu.

    Must include a user interface for the user to interact with (this can be through command line interface or graphical interface. Either way, it should be clearly and easily navigated.)

    The program should be clearly commented and documented

    The program should use a client-server configuration. Data for the users should be kept on the server either in files or a database and the client program should request the data from the server.

    At least 2 vulnerabilities must be left in the program. The vulnerabilities should be documented in private documentation. All other vulnerabilities should be considered and mitigated.

    The program can be written in any language(s), but it must be approved before work begins.

Deliverables:

    All program code with documentation (client and server code and any additional files used).
    User guide with clear descriptions of how to run and navigate the program.
    Documentation of (intentional) vulnerabilities left out in the program.

Part 1 Due Date: All deliverables above are due by  Friday, November 18 2022@ 11:59 PM.  Failure to submit on time will prevent your team from completing Part 2 of the assignment and will cause the team to fail the project.

Part 2: Finding Vulnerabilities in Other Projects

Description: Once the programs are created, teams will be assigned programs to test for vulnerabilities and present the found vulnerabilities to the class. This is the importance of not telling others the vulnerabilities used. You will not find out which team's program you are evaluating until Nov 17.

Deliverables: 

    A write-up detailing the methods used to determine the vulnerability and results of each tests (including failed attempts). This should include code snippets used. 
    A presentation  demonstrating how the program you are testing is working and the vulnerabilities you have found.

Part 2 Due Date: 

    Write-up due on November 31 @ 11:59 PM.
    Presentation  slides due on November 30 @ 11:59 PM.
    Presentations will take place on Thursday December 1 from 1:30 to 4pm  in SCCT 405.


Rubric:

    Planning document and progress reports -- 10%
    Part 1 Total -- 60%

        Meets requirements and well documented with a user guide -- 40%

        User Manual 10%
        Documentation of the two vulnerabilities left in the program --10%

    Part 2 Total -- 25%

        Overall presentation (including the demonstration) --  15% 
        Presentation of the two vulnerabilities (including the demonstration) --10%

                 NOTE: Any additional well-presented vulnerability will  earn 5 extra credits for the team. It will also cause the other team to lose 5 credits. 

    Group Evaluation - 5%
